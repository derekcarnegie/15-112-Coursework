Hi Liam,

I just wanted to thank you for taking time out of your day to talk to me today. I was really intrigued by your thoughts on the benefits of pledging Alpha Kappa Psi during the fall semester of freshman year. It was also fun to hear some of the excerpts from your own pledge process. I look forward to developing our relationship.

Best,
Derek Li

Hi Lu,

I just want to thank you for taking the time of your day to talk to me yesterday. Our conversation taught me a lot about multiple industries, like consulting, startups, and technology companies. I really appreciate all the advice you gave me on being open-minded, but also being fully committed to any decision that I make. Moving forward, I will definitely attempt to build the necessary skillset both technically and soft skills wise that we talked about. Furthermore, I really enjoyed hearing about why you like at Facebook, being intrinsically motivated to make a better product, and I hope that I can feel that same way when I get to the job market. I hope that we can meet when you come back to campus and I hope that we can continue to develop our relationship.

Best,
Derek

Dear Mr. Terry Kim,

I just wanted to follow up on my previous email. If it isn't too much of an inconvenience, would it be possible to meet this upcoming week? I appreciate your time in advance, and I look forward to seeing you soon.

Best regards,
Derek Li


I hope this email finds you well. My name is Derek Li and I am currently a freshman at Carnegie Mellon University studying Business Administration. 

As a freshman, I have been open-minded career wise and want to learn as much as I can about multiple career paths. Recently, consulting has begun to interest me for multiple reasons but would definitely love to learn more from someone in industry. I would love to speak to you on the phone in order to learn more about your time in the industry. 

Thank you in advance for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Derek
